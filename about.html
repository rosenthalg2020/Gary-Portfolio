							<p>
								My name is Gary Rosenthal. I am a new Software Developer that is looking for my opportunity to show what I know.
							   I am currently enrolled in a BS in Computer and Information Science, Software Development major, Web Design and Development track through East Coast Polytechnic Institute (ECPI).
							   My anticipated graduation date is January 24, 2021 and I have a accumulative GPA of 3.24 right now. In my studies, I have learned several different programing languages, have developed the start of a new Android app and am working towards making that app for iOS.
							   I work best with Visual Studio Code, but more than willing to learn different programs that make coding easier.<br><br>
							   I have always enjoyed computers, tinkering with computers, and building computers from scratch. In the past, I have worked outside on a golf course or in a labor intense position and computers were always a hobby.
							   In 2017, I was working clean-up on the golf course after Hurricane Irma and had a medical event that made my doctor tell me I couldnâ€™t work outside anymore.
							   My hobby has now become my passion and I quit working outside while I was taking classes to better my future.<br><br> 
							   I look forward to seeing what my skill set can do for you and your company. Please reach out to me via my contact information below.
